1. Website Frontend:
UI for File Upload: Implement a simple user interface where users can upload the stock market result PDFs.
Feedback Loop: Include a feedback mechanism for users to highlight inaccuracies or provide suggestions. This way, you can continuously improve the system.

2. Backend Processing:
PDF Extraction: Once the PDF is uploaded, extract the text from the PDF. There are multiple libraries like PyPDF2, PDFMiner, etc., that can assist in this.

Data to ChatGPT: Send the extracted text to ChatGPT with a predefined prompt as you mentioned. You'd probably need to use OpenAI's API for this, or if there's a self-hosted version available in the future, you can utilize that.
Receive Summary: Get the summarized result from ChatGPT.
prompt : "Think of your self as a stock market expert now provide a brief summary of this content along with the company name, their quarterly profits, revenue, loss, yearly comparison in your words: "

3. Convert Text to Audio:
TTS (Text-To-Speech): Convert the summary into audio. There are many TTS engines like Google Cloud Text-to-Speech, Amazon Polly, etc. Some open-source options include Mozilla's TTS.
4. Provide Audio File to User:
Download: Once the audio file is generated, provide a link for the user to download it or play it directly on the website.
5. Optional Enhancements:
Customization: Allow users to customize the kind of summary they want. For instance, a brief overview, detailed summary, or focus on specific sections.
Database: Maintain a database of already summarized reports. So, if another user uploads the same report, you can directly provide the audio without processing it again.
Subscription Model: Given the niche, you might consider offering a subscription model for regular users.
Considerations:
Accuracy: Stock market results are critical information. Ensure the summaries are accurate and do not mislead users.


 Generating a PowerPoint Presentation
For this, we'll use the officegen npm package. This package provides functionalities to generate PowerPoint presentations. We'll create a PPT slide for each of the financial metrics.

Step 3: Creating a Video
This is the most complex part. We'll use the ffmpeg tool, which is a powerful multimedia framework that can help us synchronize the audio with the PPT.

First, we need to convert the PPT to a series of images or a video. Then, we'll use ffmpeg to overlay the audio on these images to create a video.
